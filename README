This is to show how I input the matrices.  For example, to enter 2 matrices A and B of sizes 3 and 2 respectively
A =
[
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9
 ]
and 
B = 
[
  11 12
  21 22
]

We have the following input order:
2 -> number of test matrices
3 -> size of matrix; 3x3 matrix to follow
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
2 -> size of second matrix; 2x2 matrix to follow
11
12
21
